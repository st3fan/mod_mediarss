NOTE: This is work in progress. This may or may not work for you. I
have also not figured out all security aspects of this module. So use
ate your own risk.

*What is This?*

This Apache 2.0 module implements directory indexes in the Media RSS
format. The format is an extension of regular RSS 2.0 and is
documented at <http://search.yahoo.com/mrss>.

Output of MediaRSS is specially useful in cases where you want to make
a directory of files available as a podcast where for example iTunes
or a media player device can subscribe to it.


*Compiling & Installing the Module*

apxs -c mod_mediarss.c
apxs -i mod_mediarss.la


*Apache Configuration*

All you have to do is load the module:

  LoadModule mediarss_module modules/mod_mediarss.so

Directory indexes in Media RSS format are then available to all
directories that have been enabled with indexing on.
